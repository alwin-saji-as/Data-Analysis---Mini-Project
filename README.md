# Data-Analysis---Excel-PowerBI
Data cleaning and Visualisation using Microsoft Excel and PowerBI

Problem Statement: The factors influencing the Success and Failure of a Movie.

Processes Done:

1. Data Cleaning using Excel - TThe raw data consisisted of so many inconsistent data with lots of null values, unwanted characters and different character encodings. The null values were handled appropriately in such a way that if the data to be filled in the cell is unknown the whole row was deleted to make sure there is no wrong values entered while cleaning. All the unwanted characters attached to the texts were removed. The columns in wrong character encodings were changed to UNICODE (UTF-8) format. Some of the columns were removed, including the IMDB link, which were unnecessary for the visualisations. New Columns were created to organise and group the movies based on Budget, Profit and Success status of the movies. The new columns created are namaley Profit margin, Budget status, Status (success or failure), Verdict(Hit/flop), IMDB rating score and Length status. All new columns were created in accordance with the problem statement.

2. Data Visualisation using Power BI - The problem statement explicitely search for the immediate factors that affect the Success or failure of the movie. As part of visualisation the first tab consists of certain cards that help to analyse the data quickly, which gives the number of movies falling under different categories created during data cleaning. A couple of slicers are added to sort and filter them accordingly. A button was added to clear all filters by one tap. A new calculated column was created using DAX to calculate the Return on Investment(ROI) for each movie.

Insights:
   The second tab named as 'Directors vs Movie Success' gives a clear idea how b eing a branded director gives a movie enough traction to be successful. The second graph directly compares the successful and failed movies of top 10 directors who have done most number of movies in the data. The analysis shows that while experienced directors tend to have higher success counts, none demonstrate complete immunity to failure. This indicates that director reputation improves the likelihood of success but does not eliminate commercial risk. Filmmaking outcomes are influenced by multiple factors beyond directorial experience alone. This also highlights that more number of movies doesn't always converts to more successful movies. 
   The third tab named 'Budget vs Movie Verdict' directly compares the budget status of a movie to its final verdict either to be hit, average or flop. The analysis shows that while higher budgets increase production scale, they do not guarantee commercial success. Low-budget films exhibit higher failure rates but also generate successful outcomes, while high-budget films still experience significant failure. This indicates that budget alone is not a reliable predictor of success, highlighting the influence of additional factors such as direction, genre, and audience reception.
   The third tab, 'IMDB Score', analyses the influence of IMDB rating on the success or failure of a movie. The first chart compares the IMDB score gained by movies based their verdict. While the second chart analyses how IMDB score was influenced by Critics and General audience. The analysis indicates a strong relationship between IMDB rating and movie success, with hit movies generally receiving higher ratings. However, the presence of highly rated flop movies suggests that positive audience or critical reception alone does not ensure commercial success. Additionally, IMDB ratings are largely driven by audience participation rather than critics, explaining discrepancies between box-office performance and rating outcomes.
   The fourth tab named as 'Movie Length Factor' gives insight on how the length of the movie affects profitability of a movie. The first graph compares the movie length against its ROI, whereas the second chart demonstrates the length vs profit. The analysis reveals a trade-off between efficiency and scale. Short-length movies offer exceptional return on investment due to lower production costs, while normal-length movies generate the highest absolute profits due to broader market appeal. Long-length movies, however, show lower performance on both profitability and ROI, indicating increased financial risk without proportional returns.
   The fifth tab, 'Popularity Factor', is a direct comparison of Total Cast Facebook likes for a movie with it's status and how that affects the IMDB score for a movie. The data shows that movies with higher total cast Facebook likes are more likely to achieve commercial success, indicating that cast popularity strongly influences audience turnout and revenue. However, higher popularity does not consistently correspond to higher IMDB scores, suggesting that critical reception is not driven by star power alone. Movies with popular casts often perform well financially even when their ratings remain average.
   The final tab 'Movie Status across Globe' uses Map to plot the top successful movies across the world. This visual maps the geographic distribution of successful and failed movies based on their production country. The data shows that a higher concentration of successful movies originates from regions such as North America and Europe, indicating stronger commercial performance and global reach from these markets. In contrast, movies from other regions show a more mixed or limited success pattern, likely influenced by market size, distribution reach, and production scale. Overall, the map highlights how geographic origin plays a role in a movie’s likelihood of commercial success.

Final Insight:
   Based on the analysis, a movie’s success is influenced by a combination of financial, creative, and popularity-related factors rather than a single determinant. Higher budgets increase production scale but do not guarantee success, while strong return on investment is more commonly achieved by medium-budget and well-targeted productions. Director experience and consistency show a clear impact on success rates, whereas IMDb ratings and audience engagement reflect quality perception rather than assured profitability. Overall, the data indicates that balanced budgeting, audience appeal, and execution quality collectively play a more critical role in determining a movie’s success or failure than any individual factor alone.
